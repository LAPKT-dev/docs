different purposes.</p>

<p>The Atari 2600 games supported in the Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013) all feature a known initial (RAM) state and actions that have deterministic effects. Classical planners, however, cannot be used off-the-shelf as there is no compact PDDL-model of the games, and action effects and goals are not known a priori. Indeed, there are no explicit goals, and the planner must select actions on-line while interacting with a simulator that returns successor states and rewards. None of this precludes the use of blind lookahead algorithms for action selection like breadth-first search or Dijkstra's yet such methods are not effective over large state spaces. We thus turn to a different class of planning methods introduced recently that have been shown to be effective for solving large planning problems but which do not require prior knowledge of state transitions, costs (rewards) or goals. The empirical results over 54 Atari games show that the simplest such algorithm performs at the level of UCT, the state-of-the-art planning method in this domain, and suggest the potential of width-based methods for planning with simulators when factored, compact action models are not available.</p>

<p>For managing production at the scale of crop fields, maps of plant pests
are used to support farmer decisions. Such maps are costly to obtain
since they require intensive surveys in the field, most of the time
performed by human annotators or with human-controlled Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs).</p>
<p>Melissa (the nymph that gave the honey to humankind), is a project where
we look at the next challenge from an AI planning point of view: flying
fully autonomous UAVs equipped with online sequential decision-making
capabilities for pests sampling and mapping in crop fields. The system,
embarked on the UAV, continuously updates a probabilistic representation
of the crop field data from the sensing inputs, and selects a list of N
sampling plots, to eventually obtain the best reconstructed map. These
plots are then ordered, considering the side effects deriving from the
spatial model of the observed data, and a trajectory planned by the
classical planning engine (Lapkt).</p>
<p>The plan is then applied until the number of actual observations that
differ from expected ones exceeds a given threshold, which triggers a
new replanning episode. This planning method favourably compares on the
problem of weed map construction against existing greedy approaches
while adding the advantage of being adapted to autonomous UAVs' flying
time constraints.</p>

<p>We consider the problem of deriving formulas that capture traps,
invariants, and dead-ends in classical planning through polynomial forms
of preprocessing. An invariant is a formula that is true in the initial
state and in all reachable states. A trap is a conditional invariant:
once a state is reached that makes the trap true, all the states that
are reachable from it will satisfy the trap formula as well. Finally,
dead-ends are formulas that are satisfied in states that make the goal
unreachable. We introduce a preprocessing algorithm that computes traps
in k-DNF form that is exponential in the k parameter, and show how the
algorithm can be used to precompute invariants and dead-ends. We report
also preliminary tests that illustrate the effectiveness of the
preprocessing algorithm for identifying dead-end states, and compare it
with the identification that follows from the use of the h\^1 and h\^2
heuristics that cannot be preprocessed, and must be computed at run
time.</p>

<h2 id="bfws-best-first-width-search-planners">BFWS: Best First Width Search Planners<a class="headerlink" href="#bfws-best-first-width-search-planners" title="Permanent link">Link</a></h2>
<p>It has been shown recently that goal-oriented search (heuristic
exploitation) and width-based search (structural exploration) can be
combined to produce planning algorithms with a performance that goes
beyond the state-of-the-art. Such algorithms are based on best-first
width search (BFWS), a plain best-first search set with evaluations
functions combined lexicographically to break ties, some of which
express novelty based preferences. In BFWS(f5), for example, the
evaluation function f5 weights nodes by a novelty measure, breaking ties
by the number of non-achieved goals. BFWS(f5) is a best-first algorithm,
and hence, it is complete but not polynomial, and its performance
doesn't match the state of the art. In this work we show, however, that
incomplete versions of BFWS(f5) where nodes with novelty greater than k
are pruned, are not only polynomial but have an empirical performance
that is better than both BFWS(f5) and state-of-the-art planners. This is
shown by considering all the international planning competition
instances. This is the first time where polynomial algorithms with
meaningful bounds are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance in
planning. Practical and theoretical implications of this empirical
finding are briefly sketched.</p>
