The Lightweight Automated Planning Toolkit (LAPKT) is the result of a
major effort to develop a framework for writing domain-independent
planners which offered clean and clear programming interfaces. The
inspiration for investing time & effort into this is that we (Miquel
Ram√≠rez and Nir Lipovetzky) wanted to work in an environment which
constrained us the least. We didn't feel too comfortable developing our
research by just "commenting out" stuff in existing planning systems
and introducing ours.

We develop our research on top of LAPKT, so over time we will be adding
whatever we found to be useful and wasn't already present in the
toolkit.

We would like to thank Hector Geffner, as great part of the toolkit was
developed when we were his PhD. Students. Since 2013 It has been kindly
supported by the Australian Research Council linkage grant LP11010015
(Peter J. Stuckey and Adrian R. Pearce), Department of Computing and
Information Systems, The University of Melbourne.

We would like to thank the following people for having contributed
(indirectly) to this toolkit by having provided us with ideas on "how
to write a planner" by publishing or sharing their own planning
systems. In no particular order:

-   Blai Bonet
-   Joerg Hoffman
-   Patrik Haslum
-   Malte Helmert

Branding: Thanks Vaishak Belle, LAPKT (\[lapkat\]) fixed our previous
unpronounceable LWAPTK acronym . Thanks Angela Rojas for creating the
great Logo over dinner.

Quoting Joerg's remark on FF source code, "have fun"!
